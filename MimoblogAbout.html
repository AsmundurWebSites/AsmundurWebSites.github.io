          <h3>Chef</h3>
          <p>In a number of restaurants in Iceland and one in Norway from canteens to fine dining restaurants.</p>
          <p>The roles I had were as many as the restaurants</p>
          <p>I have been everything from the kitchen porter to a head chef.</p>
          <p>These postions involved:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Manageing shifts: Deciding about who is in on what day, and how shifts are structured, calling extras, hire/fire people</li>
            <li>In the kitchen there also needs to be a cleaning plan, safety plan and a training plan(for new employes)!</li>
            <li>Making sure the cleaning plan was being followed to the end of the day, then lists were checked.</li>
            <li>Then the cleaning plan had a day, week, and a month specific items to do.On some days whole cooler cleaned, some days ventilation system.</li>
            <li>Managing inventory: making sure there is enough of produce to cook everything on the menu. Most times plan some days/week ahead.</li>
            <li>Managing inventory also included prices checking and some times price chasing.</li>
            <li>Call repairmen if equipment broke. And on rare ocastions maintanence on the building painting for example. </li>
            <li>Quite a few times I was doing all the above mentioned while also being an active member on the shift, prepairing for the menu</li>
            <li>Prepairing for the menu required knowledge of vegetables,fruits,meats,breads,dairy,cross contamination,cleaning, basic first aid, being organized and many more.</li>
            <li>It also calls for planing of the the day: Decision about what to do that day, go over inventory and make decisions about freshness,quility,quantity</li>
            <li>It also icludes a working schedule at least for you, because some of the things take all day while others take 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Knowing how to cook everything for each menu: Cooking methods, Cooking time, cutting.</li>
            <li>Then there has to be an order on what you do according to the cleaning around you and your equipment.</li>
            <li>And cleaning meant a small cleaning session where you clean the nearest workspace also if you could, and arrange produce, equipment.</li>
          </ul>

          <br>
