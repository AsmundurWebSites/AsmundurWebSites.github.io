         <div class="About-content">
           <p> I first got itentersted in computers when I got a 386 (For those that don't know,<br>
             the 386 had a procesor of 20mHz., A 80mb hard drive and 512kb(yes kilobytes) of RAM.<br>
             Back then there was something called DOS, you would have to enter a command to execute windows.<br>
             I had an uncle some years older then me and he taught me how to change executeable files.<br>
             And so I tricked some friends and gave them a game that when executed it deleted it self.</p>
             <br>
             <p> Fast Forward 20 years and I have been working as a chef. I discovered when I was 17,<br>
               that I had passion for it and started working in a kitchen.<br>
               I have worked in many different restaurants everything from an canteens to fine dining.<br>
               A lot has happened in these 20 years I have met so many people from all over the world.<br>
               So I speak English,Norwegian and Swedish or maybe more a Scandinavian language.<br>
               I took some French in school, but I understand much more of it then I can talk if that makes sense.<br>
               Polish some understanding and some talking.<br>
               Some more understanig in ther languages but no talking.<br>
               In this time I have been on this work/school. Then I got a job as one of the kitchen staff.<br>
               Was there for about 6 years, then from that time I have been a shift leader, a head chef.<br>
               Shift leaders and/or head chefs have to manage orders and shifts.<br>
               <p>Also going over menus and prices. Taking out unpopular items replacing them with some thing that could be<br>
               popular, checking prices from supliers and that items on the menu have the right price according to prices from supliers.</p>
